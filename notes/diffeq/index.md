title: Ian's DiffEq Guide
---

Hello reader! Welcome to my Differential Equations guide. Below is a collection of notes I've created for M 427J at the University of Texas at Austin.

Many of these problems arose from my own studying: as a result, they come from [Braun's Differential Equations and Their Applications](http://amzn.to/2oYO2fA) or from Heitmann's homework problems. They have been copied here under Fair Use.

This guide is open source under the GPL license-- [feel free to fork it on GitHub](https://github.com/macalinao/ian.pw/tree/master/notes/diffeq).

If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to email me at [me@ian.pw](mailto:me@ian.pw).

Happy studying!
