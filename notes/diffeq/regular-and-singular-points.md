With a polynomial function, we have singular points when $y'' = 0$, otherwise it is an ordinary point.

We have regular points when you can multiply the $y$ term by $t^2$ or $y'$ term by $t$ to get a non-undefined result when $t = 0$.

### Example 1

Consider the following equation:

$$
t(t-2)^2y'' + ty' + y = 0
$$

We can rearrange it to the following:

$$
y'' + \frac{y'}{(t-2)^2} + \frac{y}{{t(t-2)^2}} = 0
$$

Since 

$$
y'' + \frac{y't}{(t-2)^2} + \frac{yt^2}{{t(t-2)^2}} = 0
$$

has both the $y'$ and $y$ term defined at $t = 0$.
