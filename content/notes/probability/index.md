title: Ian's Guide to Probability
---

Hello reader! Welcome to my Probability guide. Below is a collection of notes I've created for M 362K at the University of Texas at Austin.

Many of these problems arose from my own studying: as a result, they come from [Pitman's _Probability_](http://amzn.to/2quFXzg). They have been copied here under Fair Use.

This guide is open source under the GPL license-- [feel free to fork it on GitHub](https://github.com/macalinao/ian-website/tree/master/notes/probability).

If you have any questions or remarks, feel free to email me at [me@ianm.com](mailto:me@ianm.com).

Happy studying!
