With a polynomial function, we have singular points when $y'' = 0$, otherwise it is an ordinary point.

We have regular points when the degree of the denominator of the $y$ term is at least two more than the degree of the numerator and the denominator of the $y'$ term is at least one more than the degree of the numerator.

### Example 1

Consider the following equation:

$$
t(t-2)^2y'' + ty' + y = 0
$$

We can rearrange it to the following:

$$
y'' + \frac{y'}{(t-2)^2} + \frac{y}{{t(t-2)^2}} = 0
$$

The $y'$ term has degree 0 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator and the $y$ term has degree 0 in the numerator and 3 in the denominator, so all $t$ are regular.
